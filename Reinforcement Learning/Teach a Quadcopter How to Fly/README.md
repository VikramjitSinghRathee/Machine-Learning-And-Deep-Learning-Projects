Quadcopter_Project.ipynb is the project

In this project Reinforcement Learning was utilized to train a quadcopter agent to fly. This was achieved by specifying a reward function (task.py) that the quadcopter agent can utilize to learn which actions lead to maximization of the cumulative reward. The DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm was utlized for learning of the quadcopter agent (agent.py)
