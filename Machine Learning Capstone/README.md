The project deals with accurate estimation of the taxi fare given pickup/dropoff latitude and longitude, number of passengers, pickup date and time.

## NY_taxi_feature_Cleaning_Engineering_Scaling.ipynb

The training and testing data was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction). The data was preprocessed and scaled using sklearn library. 

## Deep_Neural_Network_Regression.ipynb

Then Deep Neural NetworK (DNN) regression was performed using Keras with Tensorflow backend to train the Neural Network utlizing training data and then prediction of the target feature was done on the testing set. These predictions were then submitted to the Kaggle competition.
