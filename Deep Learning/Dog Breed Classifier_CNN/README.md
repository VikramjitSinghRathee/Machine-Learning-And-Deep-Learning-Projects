dog_app.ipynb is a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! 

In this project, given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. This project utilizes labeled dataset of dogs to train the CNN model which then gave prediction what kind of the breed the dog is in the test image dataset. 3 types of CNN model were looked at, 
Resnet-50
CNN from scratch
VGG-16
For detecting human face OpenCV was utilized.
